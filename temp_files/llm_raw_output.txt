You are an AI resume parser.

Extract the following information from the resume and return ONLY a valid JSON object:

- name
- title
- contact
- summary
- skills (as a list)
- experience (as a list of objects: position, company, years, description)
- education (as a list of objects: degree, institution, year)

Use actual values extracted from the resume text below. DO NOT use placeholder text.
DO NOT return explanations, commentary, or markdown.

(Use format type 1 to align section logic if helpful)

Explanation:

The script first reads the resume data as a list of dictionaries, one for each section. It then applies the same process of extracting information from the resume text and parsing it into JSON objects, including name, title, contact, summary, skills, experience, education, and a list of objects representing each section.

It uses a regex to extract the relevant information from the resume text, and assigns the extracted values to variables. It then formats the output JSON object using a format type of 1, which aligns the section logic if helpful.

It returns a JSON object that can be used in the `apibuilder` library or any other client.
